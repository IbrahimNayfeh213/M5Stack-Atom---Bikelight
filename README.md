# M5Stack-Atom---Bikelight
This project's purpose was to design two different code bases that achieve different behaviours in the M5 Stack Atom Matrix device.
This development board is based around the ESP32 PICO processor, has a programmable button, 5x5 RGB LED matrix panel(WS2812C),
Built-in Infra-red LED transmitter, Built-in MPU6886 Inertial Sensor, Extendable Pins & Holes, and can be programmed through the
Arduino Environment. The project is split into two parts. The first part of the code was written for the M5 Stack Atom Matrix development board to make it function as an automatic brake light for a bicycle. The second code base for the M5 Stack Atom Matrix development board to make it function as a multi-purpose thermometer and temperature tracker.
